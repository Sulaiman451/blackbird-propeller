## Overview
This is the first task of Blackbird Australia's virtual Software Engineering experiencen on Forage entitled "Collaborate Using Github with Propeller", where the objective is to manage a repo using Github CLI. As I've never used GH CLI before, there certainly was a learning curve, so it took a few attempts for this final repo to come to fruition. 

In previous attempts, before seeing the model solution on Forage, I made the requisite changes to the source code by opening an instance of VS Code... It turns out the changes can be made from the CLI with the sed command, which I've never come across before and would do well to learn more about to get a better understanding of how to use it.

## How it was made
I used create-react-app and updated the required links and files according to task guidelines. Using GH CLI enabled me to run all git commmands and create, update, and approve a pull request from the command line. Refer to "command.sh" for a list of commands I used.
